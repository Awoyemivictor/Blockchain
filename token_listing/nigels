DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION

## What Is NIGELS TOKEN  (NIGEL)?

NIGELS token is a decentralized token built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network created by a collective of ten crypto-enthusiastic friends who ended up getting rug pulled together by a scammer known to us as Nigel..(https://www.nigels.io/). It was publicly launched on December 15, 2021 on Pancakeswap.  


NIGELS TOKEN is the native token dedicated for all those who share the plight of being scammed or rug pulled in the crypto world.


### Who Are the Founders of NIGELS TOKEN?

NIGEL TOKEN is a token launched on December 15, 2021 created by a collective of ten crypto-enthusiastic friends who ended up getting rug pulled together by a scammer known to us as Nigel.

In the aftermath of the carnage, we decided to launch our own legitimate project and name the token after the one who brought us together from those unfortunate circumstances. Although originally started as a joke, our retributive goal became to make known that a dedicated, transparent group of developers behind an honest project can and will outperform the efforts and attempts of con artists. We have dedicated this token to all those who share the plight of being scammed or rug pulled in the crypto world.
       Our team consists of members mostly from Canada and America and a couple around the globe from Singapore and Australia. We are die hard shillers, we are crypto lovers, and we are passionate about making this a social movement like no other. 

Join the cause and become a Nigel (the good kind, not the crappy scammer kind.)


#### What Makes NIGEL TOKEN Unique?

NIGEL token is dedicated to all those who share the plight of being scammed or rug pulled in the crypto world.

Nigels is a community-driven token that aims to make the crypto space safer as the result of our efforts as a collective. We plan to work towards this goal through creating crypto educational media and content, as well as highlighting legitimate crypto projects. 

The BSC space has become ubiquitously known for its amount of scams, and Nigels believes that the best way to mitigate scams is through educating new and inexperienced users through engaging content. To create a safe and legitimate token, we have burned the initial liquidity pool tokens, so liquidity can never be stolen or removed. 

The maximum wallet size is two percent of the tokenâ€™s supply to avoid large whale holdings, and the max transaction limit is one percent in order to avoid large dumps of the token. Six percent rewards are paid out to our holders in the form of BUSD, and three percent contributes to the liquidity pool of the token. We have also allocated two percent to fund marketing and development of the token.

 These funds will be used toward promoting our token, growing our community, and developing crypto safety education applications. The marketing wallet balance is visible and on display to our holders, ensuring developer transparency throughout the project's growth and evolution. Nigels is working for our holders twenty four hours a day with developers from all areas of the world. 

We have mitigated the potentially negative variable of having a single lonewolf developer by incorporating a team of motivated and dedicated individuals. This will ensure that there is always a member of the team available day or night with any concerns or questions. We pledge to be active daily with the community and help grow the coin forward as a team, while listening to the community on ways to further evolve the project. We believe that we can create a social movement in the BSC space to come together as crypto aficionados and work towards the betterment of the ecosystem.

Detailed Project Description (Cryptoasset)

## Introduction

Sports is one of the most common and effective social institutions of modern society, with the individual being its most important entity.

Only societies with healthy, educated and cultured individuals can be considered to be modern.

While its main purpose is to contribute to the physical, mental and social development of humanity, sports is also a very effective social tool for creating this society.

In addition to their benefits and roles for the individual, sports also have a very important social duty. There is a significant relationship between the way modern people do sports and how sophisticated a society is.

The purpose of this project is to reveal the social functions and dimensions of sports in third world countries that lack sufficient endorsement, to solve the problem of accessibility of younger generationsâ€™ access to sports, and to contribute to global social sports aid organizations.

## What is Bluetherium (BLUT)?

Bluetherium is a decentralized financial ecosystem for professional athletes, sports enthusiasts, and people who want to be successful in or have limited access to sports.

Acting as a reliable alternative to traditional payment solutions for consumer health and fitness products and services, Bluetherium is an organization that aims to solve major problems in the sports industry. We aim to keep our community alive and expand by offering awards through various events and activities.

## Benefits

Bluetherium aims to utilize blockchain and metaverse technology to solve the financial problems of the sports industry. By building a DeFi ecosystem tailored for sports, we aim to incentivize the community to both increase their sports activities and earn money while doing so.

### Bluetherium:
*  Is a decentralized financial ecosystem tailored for the sports industry
* Includes a mining system that involves the activities of people engaged in sports, both for professional or hobby purposes
* Is a platform where athletes and sports fans can get together

DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION

## What Is Universal Coffee Coin (UCC)?

Universal Coffee Coin is a decentralized token built on Polygon network designed as a Reward System for Coffee Lovers (Addicts) in the world.(https://www.universalcoffee.xyz/). It was publicly launched on March 28, 2022 on Uniswap.  

UCC is the native utility token used for:

* Coffee coupons shared across different coffee shops in the world
* Reward to encourage the coffee consumers and cafes to propose and implement policies for UniversalCoffeeDAO, directly contributing to the DAO ecosystem together..
* Used for governance votes to determine how network resources are allocated.

Universal Coffee Coin aims to become a universal reward point for all coffee shops in the world. 


### Who Are the Founders of UCC?

UCC is a token launched on March 29, 2022 by Eric Choi, the founder and CEO.

Eric has a lifelong attachment to cryptography. He’s also a blockchain Developer, DeFi/NFT Enthusiast, and DAO Lover who studied Data Science at Harvard University and Math at University of Notre Dame. 

Eric has stated that UCC is just the start of his dream of inventing a universal reward system in the world. 


#### What Makes UCC Unique?

UCC aims to enable DeFi services to be integrated into the real world applications.

DeFi has been experiencing a growth plateau in terms of its applications; many applications are focused only on replacing those provided by existing centralized financial systems, instead of finding real-world usages leveraging the unique advantages of DeFi. A couple of DeFi protocols reputed to be revolutionary have suffered from negative growth rate in 2022, mostly due to their missing practical applications that can produce the utility in the real world. We believe it’s finally the time for DeFi services to be integrated into the realworld applications.

Universal Coffee Coin describes UCC as “The Decentralized Coffee Reward System for Coffee Lovers (Addicts).”

In addition, UCC uses a snapshot to run a DAO. Users can submit proposals and vote on proposals with their UCC. It’s a fully decentralized protocol run by UCC holders. 


#### How Many Universal Coffee Coins (UCC) Are There in Circulation?

The total supply of UCC is 1 billion. We’ll assign 40% to the users, 20% to the affiliated cafes, 17% to the liquidity pool, 10% to the DAO contributors, and 13% to the founding team. The founding team’s share will be vested for 4 years. You can read more from our whitepaper: (https://www.universalcoffee.xyz/assets/whitePaper.6bd95fa0.pdf)

### How Is the UCC Network Secured?

The founding team renounced the ownership of the UCC contract (​​https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x1e4356a4815caf6b502070d805262551cad6eeffe74743f202718251580e9e48). This means that no one can mint UCC any more, the contract can’t be rugged, and the protocol is fully decentralized.  

##  Why UCC is better than the current coffee reward system 

1. UCC is interoperable. It can be used for all the cafes in the world that adopt UCC. With current coffee reward systems, people can use the reward points only at a specific cafe where they earned the points. 

2. UCC has a monetary value. Coffee lovers can sell UCC in the exchange for fiat money or stable coins. With the current coffee reward systems, if the cafe requires the users to use 10 points for a free coffee and the user has acquired less than 10 points, those points have no monetary value. 

3. UCC is easy to store. As long as you bring your phone and crypto wallet in your phone, UCC is stored in your wallet and you’ll never lose it. With the current coffee reward systems, a lot of coffee shops give you paper coupons that are very easy to lose or forget to bring with.

### Where Can You Buy Universal Coffee Coin (UCC)?

UCC is freely available on major exchanges, with pairs for cryptocurrencies on Uniswap.
